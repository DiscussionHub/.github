## Welcome to **DiscussionHub** 👋

![Welcome to DiscussionHub](https://github.com/DiscussionHub/.github/blob/main/images/discussion.jpg) 

You and I and everyone else today are using GitHub to create software products. It's nice that GitHub has added discussion feature to repositories. One fine day I had an idea, why not use that feature as a place to gather people to discuss something that belongs to our programming world 😁.

### 🍿 List of discussion channel

Below is a list of channels corresponding to each country:

- 🗺️ [**World**](https://opensource.guide/)
- 🇺🇸 [**United States**](https://github.com/DiscussionHub/UnitedStates/discussions)
- 🇨🇳 [**China**](https://github.com/DiscussionHub/China/discussions)
- 🇮🇳 [**India**](https://github.com/DiscussionHub/India/discussions)
- 🇻🇳 [**Vietnam**](https://github.com/DiscussionHub/Vietnam/discussions)
- ....

Don't worry if your country doesn't have its own channel, let us know and we will create it for you.

<sub>💁‍♂️ **Tips**: You should access the correct channel of your country to be able to connect with many people in your country. Conversely, go to the world channel if you want to discuss with anyone around the world.</sub>
